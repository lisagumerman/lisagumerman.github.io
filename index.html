                <p>Words words wordsiness for the old folks.  I thought all children despise effort and enjoy cartoons. I'm a comfortador also. Can't call to mom, can't say a word. No, Angel, it's not you. The only time you were ever at peace in your whole life was when you were dead. Love keeps her in the air when she ought to fall down. She alone will stand against the vampires the demons and the forces of darkness. Start with the part where Jayne gets knocked out by a ninety-pound girl, 'cause I don't think that's ever getting old. Freedom is life's great lie.</p>
