                <p>A bit of text about how beets are super important to the region. Also probably something about the Beet Shack in the museum itself, and how if you want to learn more and/or pass the quiz, you should actually go in and check it out. Lorem ipsum: There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good!</p>
